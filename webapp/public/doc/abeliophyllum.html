    <b>Abeliophyllum (White Forsythia, or Korean
Abelialeaf)</b> is a monotypic genus of flowering plants in
the olive family, Oleaceae. It consists of one species,
Abeliophyllum distichum Nakai, endemic to Korea,
where it is endangered in the wild, occurring at only
seven sites. It is related to Forsythia, but differs in having
white, not yellow, flowers.
